## Tableau Projects:

This repository contains my tableau workbooks of different dashboards and visuals, mainly focussed on exploring the tool by applying various methods on different sources of data.
Tableau is a powerful and widely used data visualization and business intelligence software. It enables users to connect to various data sources, visualize and analyze data, and 
share insights in a compelling and interactive way. Tableau is designed to make data analysis accessible to people with various levels of technical expertise, allowing them to create
interactive dashboards, reports, and charts without requiring extensive programming or coding skills.
